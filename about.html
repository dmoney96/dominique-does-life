          <p>
            Hello! I’m Dominique—a cybersecurity and OSINT professional
            passionate about helping people and organizations stay safe online.
            I co-founded BTech Solutions LLC to bring practical, affordable
            security services to small businesses in the Midwest.
          </p>

          <p>
            With experience in GRC, threat analysis, and managed security
            services, I believe in blending empathy with rigor. Part of that
            rigor includes keeping our elected representatives accountable both
            to us as constituents, and to the United States Constitution itself.
            That is why, you will see collective action and lobbying content
            right here on the Dominique Does Life website, in addition to blog
            posts and podcast episodes. Whether I’m training a client team to
            spot phishing or diving into an OSINT investigation, I’m driven by
            the same principle: if nothing we do matters, then all that matters
            is what we do right now...today... -Tim Minear "Angel"
          </p>

          <p>
            When I’m not knee-deep in code or intelligence gathering, you’ll
            find me lifting weights, practicing aerial yoga, or scambaiting
            fraudsters—legally and ethically, of course.
